# ParsC

**ParsC** is a simple and lightweight INI file parser for the C++ programming language.

## What is ParsC used for?

ParsC is used to parse all or some of the contents in an INI configuration settings (.ini) file, as well as the contents of an INF setup information (.inf) file, integrating those contents into your computer programs. This parser is for use with C++ code, and possibly C code as well.

You can integrate anything from an INI file into C/C++ source code, such as localization strings for foreign language settings in a computer program, GUI widget parameters using INI values, and other stuff that could be used in an INI or INF file for your C++ programs.

## Licensing

ParsC is licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). So you are free to use this INI parser for any of your C/C++ projects.
