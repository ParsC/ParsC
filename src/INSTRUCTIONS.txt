Guide to ParsC
========================================

Thank you for choosing ParsC, a lightweight INI (.ini) file parser for C/C++!

This is a set of instructions on how to integrate ParsC into your C++ programs.
In here, there are examples of INI configuration files, and INF setup information
(.inf) files, as ParsC can also parse those files into C++ code as well. With
that there are examples of what to do when you integrate an INI file into C/C++
code for your coding projects.

First off, you will, of course, need to make an INI configuration settings file.

-----------------------------------

Before we get to the full INI file contents, there are a few elements in INI and
INF files that you will need to add to your file(s). These include keys, sections,
names, values, delimiters, and comments. Examples of each of these INI file
elements are provided below.

--------------------
Keys/Properties
--------------------

In INI files, a key, also called a property, is the most basic element contained
in such files. Keys consist of names and values, with delimiters in between the
two elements. Keys/properties are typically not case sensitive.

Examples:

Name=Value
or
Name="Value"

--------------------
Sections
--------------------

A section is the main part of an INI file which holds a specific set of keys and
values in the file. INI sections have square brackets ([ ]) which enclose the
words included within that section. INI and INF sections do not have explicit
"end of section" delimiters, and may not be nested. Sections are optional in INI
and INF files, so you do not need to have them in your file, but they are useful
for grouping certain contents in INI files, so I would add them if I were you.

Example:

[Work Employees]

--------------------
Names
--------------------

A name is the part of an INI file which comes before the value, which we will talk
about next. Anyway, the name addresses what a set of text is, and indicates what
it does. In INI and INF files, a name must not be enclosed in any way. Characters
such as equals signs and semicolons are reserved, so you should not include them
in a name.

Names can have periods between two words, in which the leading word in that name
would be the main indicator of that property, and the following word would indicate
the specific name for that one property. Example: Names.Name1=Value

--------------------
Values
--------------------

A value is the part of an INI file which comes after the name. The value consists
of a set of text that is controlled by the leading name. Unlike names, values can
include any type of characters, including equals signs and semicolons, as they
do not play an explicit role in INI and INF files. Values can, at your preference,
be enclosed with quotation marks (""). The '%s' character is a place holder, so if
you add that in a value, do not translate it directly!

--------------------
Delimiters
--------------------

In INI and INF files, the delimiter is the most important part of these files.
The delimiter is another name for the equals sign (=). This character appears
between the name on the left and the value on the right.

--------------------
Comments
--------------------

A comment is a common element in INI and INF files. It gives text that typically
explains what a certain key/property does. Just like in all programming languages,
comment lines in INI and INF files are ignored. Comments in these files begin
with either a number sign (#) or semicolon (;).

Examples:

# This is a comment
or
; This is a comment

--------------------
Escape Characters
--------------------

Another thing you should pay attention to in both INI and INF files is a list of
common escape characters. Escape characters always begin with a backslash (\).

Common escape characters:

Single backslash (escaping the escape character): \\
Null character: \0
Bell/alert/audible: \a
Backspace: \b
Tab character: \t
Carriage return: \r
Line feed: \n
Apostrophe: \'
Double quotes: \"
Colon: \:
Semicolon: \;
Equals sign: \=
Number sign: \#

-----------------------------------

Now that we have covered the most common elements of an INI or INF file, we can
now provide some steps on how to make an INI file, with examples, as well as
instructions on how to integrate an INI or INF file into C/C++ code using ParsC,
again, with examples.

This is an example of a simple INI file, with keys, sections, names, values,
delimiters, and comments:

----------

# This is a file containing info about our employees

[Work Employees]
Employee.Employee1=Josh Wallace
Employee.Employee2=Hayley Judge
Employee.Employee3=Matt Crawford

----------

Here is another example of an INI file, same as above, but with alternate ways
of providing certain elements:

----------

; This is a file containing info about our employees

[Work Employees]
Employee.Employee1="Josh Wallace"
Employee.Employee2="Hayley Judge"
Employee.Employee3="Matt Crawford"

Of course, you can also write INI file contents with unquoted values and number
signs for comments, and vice versa, as well.

-----------------------------------

So now we have our INI file created. Now let's learn how to integrate the contents
of this file into our C++ code.

The following sample code shows a method on how to implement the special parts
of our INI file, including the sections and the names:

TCHAR Employees::getEmployeeName(const char* employeeName) const {
    if (!_employee)
        return TEXT("");

    ParsCSection* employee = reinterpret_cast<ParsCSection*>(_employee->sectionName("Work Employees"));

    if (!employee)
        return TEXT("");

    employee = employee->name("Employee");

    if (!employee)
        return TEXT("");
}

But first, however, you will need to create a C++ header (.h) file for this source
file, like this example below:

class Employees {
public:
    TCHAR getEmployeeName(const char* employeeName) const;
private:
    ParsCConfig* _employee;
};

-----------------------------------

So there you have it! Hopefully that was a comprehensive guide on how to use
ParsC effectively, for parsing INI or INF files into C or C++ code.
